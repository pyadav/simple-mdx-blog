#### What is an RFC?

RFC stands for Request for Comments, RFCs are technical documents which initiate a starting point of architectural or workflow decisions and technical verification that people used to implement in the applications.

While chats has its own place, discussions can often get "lost in the stream", Creating RFCs will ensure all stakeholders have the opportunity to voice goals and concerns at single place.

Therefore, if you have a suggestion it can often yield better results writing things out and submitting an RFC.

#### When to write RFCs

- Not sure about the implementation you have in mind, and wanting to get other people's input
- Wanting to replace or add tools to our stack
- Introducing new or changing existing conventions
- A loose idea about something to improve in the current workflow
- Planning to rewrite a major part of any application
- "I'm having this problem with X, am I the only one? How about we try out Y?"

### RFC Review Process

###### Understand why the change is being made, how it will be made, and what it is supposed to accomplish by

- Reviewing the reason, description, implementation steps
- Reviewing the resources required to implement.
- Analyzing the effect of not implementing the change

###### Assess the total risk

- The manager who approves the Request for Change (RFC) is ultimately responsible for assessing the impact of the Request for Change (RFC) before approving it.
- The factors for assessing risk (impact and probability) include: number of clients/systems affected; duration and scope of possible service disruption; availability of work-around; the criticality of the services being disrupted; awareness of the impact to the organization.

###### Assess whether the Implementation schedule is appropriate for the Request for Change (RFC)

###### Check the type of Request for Change (RFC) (normal, emergency) and assess whether it is appropriate, based on the total impact and proposed schedule.

###### Assess whether or not communication is needed based on the risk (impact and probability).

### Responsibilities of RFC Reviewer

- Reviews and approves all high and critical impact Request for Change's (RFC's) no matter the probability.
- Ensures Post Implementation Reviews (PIRs) are performed when required and properly documented.
